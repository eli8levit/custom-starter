<p align="center">ðŸš€ Start your projects fast simply using already created boilerplate repos</p>

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jediyozh/custom-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jediyozh/custom-starter)

## The problem

In each project you start you need to create and install same files and modules as were in the previous one: configs, linters, dev packages. Maybe you have some saved gists so you go and copy them each time into new projects. Itâ€™s tiring and slowâ€¦

## This solution

You create boilerplate repo (on GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, your own...whatever you want!) with files and packages that arenâ€™t being changed. Next you save a starter simple writing `custom-starter add` providing a name and url to the repo. Use it next time you start some project. It clones all files to the current project and **installs all packages if `package.json` exists**. You can add as many boilerplate repos as you want.
